  utter_faq/corona_intro:
  - text: Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness
      in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known
      to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
      severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
      and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
      discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.
  utter_faq/corona_spread:
  - text: People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
      disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
      the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
      coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
      around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
      these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
      People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
      person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
      why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
      person who is sick.
  utter_faq/corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission
      of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
      to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food
      safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing
      or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
  utter_faq/warm_weather:
  - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
      cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
      these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
      spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
      more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
      with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
  utter_faq/high_risk:
  - text: Elderly people above 70 years of age and those with underlying health conditions
      (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer)
      are considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms.
      Men in these groups also appear to be at a slightly higher risk than females..
  utter_faq/corona_come_from:
  - text: corona viruses are viruses that circulate among animals with some of them
      also known to infect humans. Bats are considered natural hosts of these viruses
      yet several other species of animals are also known to act as sources.
      For instance, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) is transmitted
      to humans from camels, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus-1 (SARS-CoV-1)
      is transmitted to humans from civet cats.
      More information on corona viruses can be found in the ECDC factsheet.
  utter_faq/corona_vs_sar_flu:
  - text: The novel corona virus detected in China in 2019 is closely related
      genetically to the SARS-CoV-1 virus. SARS emerged at the end of 2002 in China,
      and it caused more than 8 000 cases in 33 countries over a period of eight months.
      Around one in ten of the people who developed SARS died. As of 30 March 2020,
      the COVID-19 outbreak had caused over 700 000 cases worldwide since the first case
      was reported in China in January 2020. Of these, more than 30 000 are known to have died.
      While the viruses that cause both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza are transmitted from
      person-to-person and may cause similar symptoms, the two viruses are very different
      and do not behave in the same way.
  utter_faq/mode_of_transmission:
  - text: While animals are believed to be the original source, the virus spread is now
        from person to person (human-to-human transmission).There is not enough epidemiological
        information at this time to determine how easily this virus spreads between people,
        but it is currently estimated that, on average, one infected person will infect between
        two and three other people.The virus seems to be transmitted mainly via small respiratory
        droplets through sneezing, coughing, or when people interact with each other for some time
        in close proximity (usually less than one metre). These droplets can then be inhaled,
        or they can land on surfaces that others may come into contact with, who can then get infected
        when they touch their nose, mouth or eyes.
        The virus can survive on different surfaces from several hours (copper, cardboard)
        up to a few days (plastic and stainless steel). However, the amount of viable virus declines
        over time and may not always be present in sufficient numbers to cause infection.
        The incubation period for COVID-19 (i.e. the time between exposure to the virus and onset of symptoms)
        is currently estimated to bet between one and 14 days. We know that the virus can be transmitted
        when people who are infected show symptoms such as coughing. There is also some evidence suggesting
        that transmission can occur from a person that is infected even two days before showing symptoms;
        however, uncertainties remain about the effect of transmission by  non-symptomatic persons.
  utter_faq/person_infectious:
  - text: The infectious period may begin one to two days before symptoms appear,
        but people are likely most infectious during the symptomatic period, even if symptoms are mild and very non-specific.
        The infectious period is now estimated to last for 7-12 days in moderate cases and up to two weeks on average in severe cases.

  utter_faq/severity:
  - text: Preliminary data from the EU/EEA (from the countries with available data) show that around 20-30% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases are hospitalised
        and 4% have severe illness. Hospitalisation rates are higher for those aged 60 years and above, and for those with other underlying health conditions.

  utter_faq/child_risk:
  - text: Children make up a very small proportion of reported COVID-19 cases,
        with about 1% of all cases reported being under 10 years, and 4% aged 10-19 years.
        Children appear as likely to be infected as adults, but they have a much lower risk
        than adults of developing symptoms or severe disease.
        There is still some uncertainty about the extent to which asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children transmit disease.

  utter_faq/pregnant_risk:
  - text: There is limited scientific evidence on the severity of illness in pregnant women after COVID-19 infection.
        It seems that pregnant women appear to experience similar clinical manifestations as non-pregnant women who
        have progressed to COVID-19 pneumonia and to date (as of 25 March), there have been no maternal deaths,
        no pregnancy losses and only one stillbirth reported. No current evidence suggests that infection with COVID-19
        during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus. At present, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19
        from mother to baby during pregnancy and only one confirmed COVID-19 neonatal case has been reported to date.
        ECDC will continue to monitor the emerging scientific literature on this question, and suggests that all pregnant women
        follow the same general precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals
        who are sick, and self-isolating in case of any symptoms, while consulting a healthcare provider by telephone for advice.

  utter_faq/when_test:
  - text: Current advice for testing depends on the stage of the outbreak in the country or area where you live.
        Testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at national and local level.
        National authorities may decide to test only subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test,
        the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or other criteria.
        As a resource conscious approach, ECDC has suggested that national authorities may consider prioritising testing in the following groups,
        hospitalised patients with severe respiratory infections; symptomatic healthcare staff including those with mild symptoms;
        cases with acute respiratory infections in hospital or long-term care facilities;
        patients with acute respiratory infections or influenza-like illness in certain outpatient clinics or hospitals;
        elderly people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure,
        cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions.

  utter_faq/where_test:
  - text: If you are feeling ill with COVID-19 symptoms (such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain or general weakness),
        it is recommended that you contact your local healthcare services online or by telephone. If your healthcare provider believes
        there is a need for a laboratory test for the virus that causes COVID-19, he/she will inform you of the procedureto follow
        and advise where and how the test can be performed.

  utter_faq/other_allergy:
  - text: A large proportion of the population (up to 15-20%) reports seasonal symptoms related to pollen,
        the most common of which include itchy eyes, nasal congestion, runny nose and sometimes wheezing and skin rash.
        All these symptoms are usually referred to as hay fever, pollen allergy or more appropriately allergic rhinitis.
        Allergic rhinitis is commonly associated with allergic asthma in children and adults. Allergies, including mild allergic asthma,
        have not been identified as a major risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for a more unfavourable outcome in the studies available so far.
        Moderate to severe asthma on the other hand, where patients need treatment daily,
        is included in the chronic lung conditions that predispose to severe disease.
        Children and adults on maintenance medication for allergies (e.g. leukotriene inhibitors, inhaled corticosteroids and/or bronchodilators)
        need to continue their treatment as prescribed by their doctor and should not discontinue their medication due to fears of COVID-19.
        If they develop symptoms compatible with COVID-19, they will need to self-isolate, inform their doctor and monitor their health as everyone else.
        If progressive difficulty breathing develops, they should seek prompt medical assistance.

  utter_faq/other_allergy_vs_covid:
  - text: Someone with COVID-19 usually has mild, flu-like symptoms (see above question 1),
        which are rather common and need to be distinguished from similar symptoms caused by common cold viruses and
        from allergic symptoms during springtime. The following table presents a comparison of the most common symptoms
        of all three conditions according to their reported frequency. It is good to bear in mind that the definitive diagnosis of COVID-19
        is not clinical, but through laboratory testing of a sample from the nose or mouth.

  utter_faq/allergy_treatment:
  - text: No, there is no more reason for people suffering from pollen allergy to self-isolate if they develop their typical
        hay-fever symptoms than for anyone else. They should continue following the general guidance for physical distancing
        and seek medical advice if their symptoms get worse, if they develop fever or progressive difficulty breathing.

  utter_faq/avoid_infection:
  - text: The virus enters your body via your eyes, nose and/or mouth, so it is important to avoid touching your face
        with unwashed hands. Washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or cleaning hands thoroughly
        with alcohol-based solutions, gels or tissues is recommended in all settings.
        It is also recommended to stay one metre or more away from people infected with COVID-19 who are showing symptoms,
        to reduce the risk of infection through respiratory droplets.

  utter_faq/symptoms:
  - text: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
        congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
        usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
        don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
        (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
        treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
        becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
        and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure,
        heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
        People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

  utter_faq/virus_transmission:
  - text: Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact
        with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?"

  utter_faq/caught_from_non_symptom:
  - text: The virus enters your body via your eyes, nose and/or mouth, so it is important to avoid touching your face
        with unwashed hands. Washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or cleaning hands thoroughly
        with alcohol-based solutions, gels or tissues is recommended in all settings.
        It is also recommended to stay one metre or more away from people infected with COVID-19 who are showing symptoms,
        to reduce the risk of infection through respiratory droplets.

  utter_faq/caught_from_feces:
  - text: The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low.
        While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route
        is not a main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings.
        Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.

  utter_faq/protection_covid:
  - text: Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,available on the national,state and local public health authority.
        Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries
        have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
        You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID19 by taking some simple precautions
        • Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
          Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
        • Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
          Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you
          are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
        • Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
          Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
          nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
        • Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
        with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
        Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as
        cold, flu and COVID-19.
        • Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
        Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date
        information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
        health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.
        • Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid
        traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
        Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.


  utter_faq/get_catch_covid:
  - text: The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
        For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
        areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
        and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
        restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.
        COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,
        new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go.

  utter_faq/worry_covid:
  - text: Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness
        about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19
        outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
        loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory
        hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel,
        movement and gatherings.

  utter_faq/risk_of_severe:
  - text: While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such
        as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.


  utter_faq/antibiotic_helpful:
  - text: NO. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do
        not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed
        by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.


  utter_faq/medicine_helpful:
  - text: While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence
        that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. We does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics,
        as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional
        medicines. We will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available.

  utter_faq/vaccine_covid:
  - text: Presently, Covishield and Covaxin are the two types of vaccine available in India.
        You will get one of these two vaccines but can not choose the vaccine that you would like to take.
        Which vaccine will be given to you, will be decided by the vaccine provider according to allocation.
        The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with
        the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.

  utter_faq/covid_vs_sar:
  - text: No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are
        related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different.
        SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19.
        There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

  utter_faq/mask_protect:
  - text: Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.
        Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is
        a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks wisely.
        We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most
        effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow
        or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.

  utter_faq/handle_mask:
  - text: Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.
        2. Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water
        3. Take the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.
        4. Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).
        5. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).
        6. Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.
        7. Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.
        8. After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes,
           to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask.
        9. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.
        10. Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash
            your hands with soap and water.

  utter_faq/infection_from_animal:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which
        may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by
        dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.
        To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals.
        Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods
        and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products.

  utter_faq/infection_from_pet:
  - text: While there has been one instance of a dog being infected in Hong Kong, to date, there is no evidence that a dog, cat or any pet can
        transmit COVID-19. COVID-19 is mainly spread through droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks.
        To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently and thoroughly.
        We continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID19 topics and will update as new findings are available.

  utter_faq/survive_on_surface:
  - text: It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
        suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
        several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
        If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with
        an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.

  utter_faq/package:
  - text: Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19
        from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.

  utter_faq/incubation_period:
  - text: The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease.
        Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days.
        These estimates will be updated as more data become available.
